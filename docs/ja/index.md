The [KOMOJU](https://en.komoju.com/) Japanese Payments extension provides an easy way to accept Japanese payments for your Magento store. During checkout your customer will be shown a hosted checkout page to enter their details, so you don't have to worry about storing credit card details or secret information. Note: Currently the extension only allows payments for stores with JPY as the base currency.
